# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

In today's online gaming landscape, Indie games are a huge growing industry. However, there are so many amazing indie games that it can be hard to keep track of them all, and many good ones fly entirely under the radar. This is because information about these games is scattered around various websites, there is no centralized place to learn about and talk about indie projects. Indie-Link is a place where developers and users can upload information about indie games. This could be a great way not only for developers to gain new players but also for players to meet fellow fans of the game and discuss it. The app would organize games by genre and platform so users could search for new games that fit their needs and interests. 

## Methods

One of the first research methods we performed was a competitive analysis. We brainstormed a list of competitors including Steam, Roblox, itch.io, and Reddit. For each, we compared our personal goals with how well each competitor allowed the user to achieve these goals. The main goals we considered were the breadth of game discovery allowed on the site and the ability for developers to interact with players. 

Another research method we performed was through the use of personas and scenarios. We created two personas based on our main two goals of game discovery and user-developer interaction. We then created two scenarios, one for each of them. For each scenario, we considered what features we could create to aid them the most efficiently in their goals of using our site.

The last research method used was a heuristic evaluation. Using Neilsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, each of us evaluated a competitor, itch.io, and gave it a 1-10 scale score for each heuristic. Using this evaluation of what our competitor did well and poorly in terms of usability, we considered how we could design our site to be more user-friendly than our competitor. 

## Findings

Our competitive analysis found a common issue of breadth of game discovery. Each competitor was restricted by the fact that they were a storefront. They could only allow the discovery of the games they had up for purchase and/or download. There was no cross-storefront or cross-platform discoverability. Furthermore, a site like Reddit, while it allows for developer-player interaction, does not have an efficient way to search through games as the site was not created for that purpose.  
From the personas and scenarios, we were able to learn a few things about different types of potential site users. For one, players may have limited time available to play games, and to not waste that time searching through game titles for the right one, they need a way to narrow down their results. Meanwhile, developers have a desire for their game to be successful, but success requires a fanbase. A good way to build rapport with their fans is to have a way to communicate with them and showcase game development. These are two very different needs but each falls within the goals of the site, and we need to find a way to efficiently supply solutions for both problems.  
Lastly, our evaluation of a competitor, itch.io, revealed several strengths and weaknesses that we could build off of.  One thing we learned was the importance of navigation consistency. The navigation bar on the site changes frequently depending on the page, making navigation confusing. Furthermore, there are few to no back buttons on the site making it difficult to undo misclicks. Secondly, the site is very busy. There are too many buttons, tabs, and pictures. It all feels very cluttered. This also led to a third issue which was overcustomization. It is good to let people customize the game pages to match the game, but at a certain point, the differences between pages can make them feel as if they are from completely different sites. There needs to be a limit to how much the user can customize a page to maintain some consistency on the site. Lastly, error prevention was a major issue. Misclicks and mistakes should be simple to fix. Each page and popup needs a cancel or back button, and forms should warn the user if they havenâ€™t filled out something properly. 

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
