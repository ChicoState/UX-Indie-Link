# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Indie Link aims to provide a way for indie game players to find new games and game developers to make connections with fans. This stage of development focused on creating the wireframe for the site and then performing a cognitive walkthrough study of the wireframes to test their effectiveness. 

## Methods

The UX Team employed peer cognative walkthroughs to acomblish diversity in findings.

Peer cognative walkthroughs are much more effective because the UX team created the scenerios, the personas, and the wireframes. The UX team has a deep understanding of what Indie Link is and what the intended goal of the site is, whereas a user will not have familiarity with the site.

The SE team performed a round of informal feedback on their current build of the site. For this process, they first got the following list of questions from the UX team to ask in their feedback session: 
1. Does the current structure allow for discoverability?
2. Are there any preferred features missing from the landing page?
3. Is the landing page too busy?

The team then presented their current build of the site to their peers in class. Afterward, they asked the questions provided by the UX team and recorded the feedback provided. 

## Findings

Our peer cognative walkthroughs and wireframes can be found [here](/wireframes/Cognitive%20Walkthroughs/)

In the results from the cognitive walkthroughs, the UX team found that the social element of our site had been left off of the wireframes. They also found that the tagging system needed to be fleshed out further and fully implemented into the wireframe as the process of adding tags was not clear. The walkthrough also revealed the importance of icons, as the lack of those images on the wireframes made them difficult to traverse. Finally, we discovered a possible issue with the flow of user interaction with the site when it comes to discovering new games. In its current state, the site does not allow for game downloads by design, as it is meant to act as more of an archive than a storefront. However, this design also neglects to allow the viewer to find the storefront where the game is located, leading to a gap in the user's experience with the site. This creates another problem as if a user finds a game that they want to download, they must leave the site in order to download. This can prove to be an issue with user retention.

Indie Link's current design has a problem where the user is encouraged to leave the site as fast as possible in many circumstances.

The SE team found through their informal feedback that the current build still needed to develop account creation, a search function, a fully developed landing page that lists games posted by developers, and user-to-developer communication. 

## Conclusions

The results of the cognitive walkthrough showed a need for greater attention to detail in our wireframes, and a need to work out an effective way to implement the social aspect of the site, something we had been neglecting until now. It also showed that effective icons for the various site functions are imperative to users being able to know where to click to achieve their goals. To have the wireframes better communicate these icons' presence, placeholder icons needed to be added to the wireframes. In the future, we may also need to consider implementing a way for developers to link to the storefronts their game is available on. This would allow a more seamless user experience.

The SE's informal feedback process showed that the site still needs quite a bit of development before it can be considered functional, as it currently is not capable of many of the site's intended functions. 

As we progress into the final phase of development it is important to keep in mind the needs of the user's and the goal of the site. Cognitive walkthroughs can only provide as much information as 

## Caveats

There are a few limitations to the cognitive walkthrough as we only ran the study using two people. As such we do not have a very large sample size of data to work from. There may be several issues that went unnoticed. The UX team used two user stories for the walkthrough as such there may be some functions of the site that were not covered by the peer cognative walkthroughs. At the time of the walkthroughs the wireframes were at an early stage of development, which led to issues found in the walkthrough were caused by the wireframes rather than the site's design. 

The use of wireframes as opposed to paper prototypes or other prototypes led to a lack of context clues for what a button does, and lacks the context clues that would be present on the site. 

In both of our [scenerios](), the user was in the younger age demographic, and somewhat technical savy. In future cognative walkthroughs, more diverse scenerios will lead to more effective and user friendly design. From our findings, we only learned about a young, technical savy demographic. 

On the SE side of things, the site was largely unfinished, which caused many of the issues found to be rooted in the site's stage of development rather than the design itself. Informal review is also done with a small sample size of peers, which means the people reviewing the site come from a common demographic. This common viewpoint can lead to blind spots in the review that can leave some issues undiscovered.
