# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

 **Executive Summary**

- Indie Link, is a website designed to allow indie game players to discover new games and developers to connect with fans. 
- The UX team conducted a cognitive walkthrough of the wireframes created for a site.
     - Participants attempted to achieve the goal of one of the two scenarios created in Phase I.
     - This process effectively acted as a test of an early prototype.
     - The Process provided the team with insight into issues with the wireframes and design.
        - It was found that the wireframes were lacking core features like commenting.
        - It made clear that certain revisions such as the additions of placeholders for icons were needed to make the content of the wireframes clearer.
- The SE team performed an informal feedback session
   - The team presented the site and asked questions to find out if the site was working effectively to meet user needs.
   - The feedback found that the site still needed more work to implement the core functions of the design such as account creation, search functionality, a landing page, and commenting functionality.
   - This discovery pushed the team to develop the site to a more functional form.
