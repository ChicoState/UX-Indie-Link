# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Indie Link aims to provide a way for indie game players to find new games and game developers to make connections with fans. This stage of development focused on creating the prototype for the site and then performing a usability test to find issues with the current design. 

## Methods
The prototype of the site was developed using the previously developed wireframes as a template. Color and images were added to increase the fidelity of the prototype. The higher fidelity we could make the prototype the more accurate the data would be from our user test, and the more likely we would be to find problems with the design. 

We developed a [protocol](Phase_III:_Usability_Evaluation/) to follow in our test. The protocol consisted of a list of questions and tasks for the participant to complete to determine the current usability of various functions of the site. 


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
