# Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bill

- Bill wants to study for his upcoming quiz, he does not like to study for extremely
long lengths of time, so he breaks up his study sessions with two hour blocks of gaming.
He wants to find a new game, but he doesn't have the time, so he often falls back on his
old favorites. Some of the games donâ€™t excite him the same way that they used to. He
then goes back to studying and falls asleep when he feels he has completed his work.
He wishes that he could have spent his time better, and searches on reddit for a new
game to play. He needs some way to cut down on all the noise and find the game that
works for him.

### Scenario 2: Olivia
  
- Olivia has just finished her latest horror indie game. She is determined this time to find a
way to make her game more visible, and to build a community around it. She gets on
the computer and begins looking for places to post something about it. She needs some
way to not only make her game easily found but also to communicate with players.
