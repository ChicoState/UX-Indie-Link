# Peer Cognitive Walkthrough
## Scenario A:

Bill wants to study for his upcoming quiz, he does not like to study for
extremely long lengths of time, so he breaks up his study sessions with two hour blocks
of gaming. He wants to find a new game, but he doesn’t have the time, so he often falls
back on his old favorites. Some of the games don’t excite him the same way that they
used to. He then goes back to studying and falls asleep when he feels he has completed
his work. He wishes that he could have spent his time better, and searches on reddit for
a new game to play. He needs some way to cut down on all the noise and find the game
that works for him.

### Steps
1. I've heard about this new site, and it looks like I need to make an account, so I'll go through
the sign up process.
    - This seems straightforward
2. Now that I've signed up, I'll search for games that are shorter in length.
    - It's unclear what you can search by in these wireframes, the example you give is by
genre, but do other filters work too?
3. I want to narrow down my search to genres I'm interested in, so I'll add some tags that fit
my criteria.
    - I'm not sure what tags I'm able to add though. Is this moreso user generated tags, like
on steam?
4. Now that I've found a game, I want to catch up on it, so I'll click on the game page. It
doesn't look like there's a way for me to download it here, so I'll check the developer post
page.
    - Not being able to download games here does seem like a lacking feature, but I can
understand the choice not to include it.
5. It seems like I have to go to another site to download this game, so I think I'm done here!
    - It does seem like redirecting users to other sites, like itch.io, that have similar features
may result in less user retention.

## Scenario B: 
Olivia has just finished her latest horror indie game. She is determined this time to find a way 
to make her game more visible, and to build a community around it. She gets on the 
computer and begins looking for places to post something about it. She needs some way to 
not only make her game easily found but also to communicate with players. 
 
### Steps: 
1. Homepage: Looking around for a place to post about new game: 
    1. I logged in, super seamless. I see all my games and favorites! Yay, right where I left 
them. 
    2. I want to post my new game, but I don’t know what to do--When logged in, I can see 
“my games” but I don’t see an area or button to add my new game. 
    3. How do I get to “Create a game” page? 
    4. I am going to click around until I find where I want to go. I can search “post new 
game”?  I might have to go back to my account home page a few times after clicking 
around before getting to the add my new game page? Will I ever get there? 
    5. I give up, I can’t find a way to get to the “Create a game” page. 
--BUT assuming that I did get to the page where I can “Create game”, because I see it 
from the wireframes, assume I made my way there: 
    6. I have all of the Text Entry boxes I need to post my game! 
    7. I see a clear submit button on the bottom right, but what if I want to preview before 
publishing?  
    8. Assuming that my game is absolutely perfect and ready for posting, I click “Submit” 
--This has brought me slightly closer to my goal, I have my game posted! 
    9. Where do I see where it has been posted to? On “My games” tab? Is there a 
confirmation that my new game has been created/posted? I will go and search 
around again to confirm this. 
 
2. Communicate with players about new game: 
 
    1. I don’t see anywhere to communicate with anyone. Players, creators, developers... 
    2. Is this just a game index? Are there any social elements to this site? 
    3. This has halted me in my goal and no progress has been made in regard to 
communicating with players.

### Cognitive Walkthrough Questions
1. Will the user know what to do at this step? 
2. If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making 
progress toward the goal?
