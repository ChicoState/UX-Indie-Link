# Peer Cognitive Walkthrough
### Scenario A:

Bill wants to study for his upcoming quiz, he does not like to study for
extremely long lengths of time, so he breaks up his study sessions with two hour blocks
of gaming. He wants to find a new game, but he doesn’t have the time, so he often falls
back on his old favorites. Some of the games don’t excite him the same way that they
used to. He then goes back to studying and falls asleep when he feels he has completed
his work. He wishes that he could have spent his time better, and searches on reddit for
a new game to play. He needs some way to cut down on all the noise and find the game
that works for him.

### Steps
1. I've heard about this new site, and it looks like I need to make an account, so I'll go through
the sign up process.
    - This seems straightforward
2. Now that I've signed up, I'll search for games that are shorter in length.
    - It's unclear what you can search by in these wireframes, the example you give is by
genre, but do other filters work too?
3. I want to narrow down my search to genres I'm interested in, so I'll add some tags that fit
my criteria.
    - I'm not sure what tags I'm able to add though. Is this moreso user generated tags, like
on steam?
4. Now that I've found a game, I want to catch up on it, so I'll click on the game page. It
doesn't look like there's a way for me to download it here, so I'll check the developer post
page.
    - Not being able to download games here does seem like a lacking feature, but I can
understand the choice not to include it.
5. It seems like I have to go to another site to download this game, so I think I'm done here!
    - It does seem like redirecting users to other sites, like itch.io, that have similar features
may result in less user retention.
