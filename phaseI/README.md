# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

In today's online gaming landscape, Indie games are a huge growing industry. However, there are so many amazing indie games that it can be hard to keep track of them all, and many good ones fly entirely under the radar. This is because information about these games is scattered around various websites, there is no centralized place to learn about and talk about indie projects. Indie-Link is a place where developers and users can upload information about indie games. This could be a great way not only for developers to gain new players but also for players to meet fellow fans of the game and discuss it. The app would organize games by genre and platform so users could search for new games that fit their needs and interests. 

## Methods

One of the first research methods we performed was a competitive analysis. We brainstormed a list of competitors including Steam, Roblox, itch.io, and Reddit. For each, we compared our personal goals with how well each competitor allowed the user to achieve these goals. The main goals we considered were the breadth of game discovery allowed on the site and the ability for developers to interact with players. 

Another research method we performed was through the use of personas and scenarios. We created two personas based on our main two goals of game discovery and user-developer interaction. We then created two scenarios, one for each of them. For each scenario, we considered what features we could create to aid them the most efficiently in their goals of using our site.

The last research method used was a heuristic evaluation. Using Neilsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, each of us evaluated a competitor, itch.io, and gave it a 1-10 scale score for each heuristic. Using this evaluation of what our competitor did well and poorly in terms of usability, we considered how we could design our site to be more user-friendly than our competitor. 

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
