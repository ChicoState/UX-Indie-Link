# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Indie Link aims to provide a way for indie game players to find new games and game developers to make connections with fans. This stage of development focused on creating the wireframe for the site and then performing a cognitive walkthrough study of the wireframes to test their effectiveness. 

## Methods

The UX Team employed [peer cognitive walkthroughs](../wireframes/Walkthroughs/) to accomplish diversity in findings.

Peer cognitive walkthroughs are much more effective because the UX team created the scenarios, personas, and wireframes. The UX team has a deep understanding of what Indie Link is and what the intended goal of the site is, whereas a user will not have familiarity with the site.

The SE team performed a round of informal feedback on their current build of the site. For this process, they first got the following list of questions from the UX team to ask in their feedback session: 
1. Does the current structure allow for discoverability?
2. Are there any preferred features missing from the landing page?
3. Is the landing page too busy?

The team then presented their current build of the site to their peers in class. Afterward, they asked the questions provided by the UX team and recorded the feedback provided. 

## Findings

Our peer cognitive walkthroughs and wireframes can be found [here](../wireframes/Walkthroughs/)

Our peers questioned how tags would be generated and suggested adding user generated tags. This seems like and interesting idea and could solve a lot of the issues we currently have with the tagging system. It was also discovered how the search feature needs to be fleshed out more, the current design does not provide user feedback on what they can search.

The SE team found through their informal feedback that the current build still needed to develop account creation, a search function, a fully developed landing page that lists games posted by developers, and user-to-developer communication.

Indie Link's current design has a problem where the user is encouraged to leave the site as fast as possible in many circumstances.

The SE team found through their informal feedback that the current build still needed to develop account creation, a search function, a fully developed landing page that lists games posted by developers, and user-to-developer communication. 

## Conclusions

The results of the cognitive walkthrough showed a need for greater attention to detail in our wireframes, and a need to work out an effective way to implement the social aspect of the site, something we had been neglecting until now. It also showed that effective icons for the various site functions are imperative to users being able to know where to click to achieve their goals. To have the wireframes better communicate these icons' presence, placeholder icons needed to be added to the wireframes. In the future, we may also need to consider implementing a way for developers to link to the storefronts their game is available on. This would allow a more seamless user experience.

The SE's informal feedback process showed that the site still needs quite a bit of development before it can be considered functional, as it currently is not capable of many of the site's intended functions. 

As we progress into the final phase of development it is important to keep in mind the needs of the users and the goal of the site. Cognitive walkthroughs can only provide as much information as the UX team puts into them. More thorough and diverse personas and scenerios can provide much needed feedback and data on how to improve the current design. 

This phase provided us great feedback, a better understanding of our users, and what the UX team need to focus on when moving on to the final phase of the project. The UX team have gained important insight on what needs to be focused on when developing prototypes and the final revisions.

## Caveats

There are a few limitations to the cognitive walkthrough as we only ran the study using two people. As such we do not have a very large sample size of data to work from. There may be several issues that went unnoticed. The UX team used two user stories for the walkthrough as such there may be some functions of the site that were not covered by the cognitive walkthroughs. At the time of the walkthroughs, the wireframes were at an early stage of development, which led to issues found in the walkthrough being caused by the wireframes rather than the site's design. 

The use of wireframes as opposed to paper prototypes or other prototypes led to a lack of context clues for what a button does and lacks the context clues that would be present on the final site. 

In both of our [scenerios](../personas/), the user was a younger demographic and somewhat technically savvy. In future cognitive walkthroughs, more diverse scenarios will lead to more effective and user-friendly design. From our findings, we only learned about a young, technically savvy demographic. 

On the SE side of things, the site was largely unfinished, which caused many of the issues found to be rooted in the site's stage of development rather than the design itself. Informal review is also done with a small sample size of peers, which means the people reviewing the site come from a common demographic. This common viewpoint can lead to blind spots in the review that can leave some issues undiscovered.
