## Indie Link Protocol!!!
### Introduction
(Following informed consent…) Hello and thank you for agreeing to join a study on the usability
of a new social media site, Indie Link! Today we will be looking over prototypes to see how you
would use the website. This will be a test of how the website functions rather than a personal
test of you. We are evaluating the design of the site.
 
While you use the site, we would like you to “Think Aloud”, meaning you will speak all of your
thoughts including what you like, dislike, or what you think is confusing. We want to make the
site as accessible as possible so your feedback will be important. We will be having a moderator
and a dedicated note-taker.

Your thoughts will be recorded via pencil and paper, but you will not be recorded at this time.
We will be taking notes on what you are saying or doing, but not recordings.
### Background
#### Are you a game developer?

#### (If game developer) How do you attract players?

#### What kind of games do you like to play?

#### Do you play any indie games?

- #### (If you play indie games) How do you usually find a new game to play?

#### How do you currently find new games to play and what do you like or dislike about those tactics?

### Task 1
Imagine you are looking for a new game to play. Look for a game in your favorite genre.
If you want to play an action-heavy game, how can you find a list of games that fulfill the
requirement?

### Task 2
Imagine a scenario in which you are excited about the upcoming release of a new game. This
game’s developer is active on Indie Link and is posting regular updates. You have a suggestion
that you want to share with the developer, is there anything on the site that achieves that
functionality?
